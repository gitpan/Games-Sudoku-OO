NAME
    Games::Sudoku::OO::Board - Object oriented Sudoku solver

SYNOPSIS
      use Games::Sudoku::OO::Board;
      my $board = Sudoku::OO::Board->new();
      $board->importGrid($txt_grid);

      print $board->toStr;

      # Solve one step   
      $board->solve(1);
      print $board->toStr;

      # Solve the whole board
      $board->solve(all);
      print $board->toStr;

DESCRIPTION
    Games::Sudoku::OO takes an object oriented approach to solving Sudoku,
    representing the column, row and square as derivatives of a base Set
    class, which encapsulates the solving rules. The Board class is also
    composed of cells (which know what set they are in) and is only
    responsible for loading and updating the cells and interacting with the
    users. The sets themselves do the solving.

USAGE
BUGS
    - Doesn't solve all boards - Display of unsolved boards is a bit odd
